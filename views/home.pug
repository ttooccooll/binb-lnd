        h3 How to play?
        p All you have to do is to guess the song that is playing. A fixed number 
          | of songs will run and for each one correctly guessed you will earn an 
          | amount of points. That amount depends on the number of correct guesses 
          | (artist and/or title of the song) and on how fast you will be on 
          | answering compared to other players. At the end a scoreboard will 
          | report the best three players of the match. If you have read this 
          | far, what are you waiting? Click on a room below and prove your 
          | music knowledge!
